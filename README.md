# POMP-ELO: Enhancing ELO Ratings with Dynamic Covariates for NBA Predictions
This repository contains the code and methodology behind POMP-ELO, a model developed to enhance the traditional ELO rating system by incorporating dynamic covariates for predicting the performance of NBA teams—specifically focusing on the Houston Rockets over the 2023–2025 seasons. 
The code was originally maintained in a repository by a co-author [Nick Kim](https://github.com/nick-kimm/STAT531-Final).

## Overview
The classic ELO rating system, while effective for ranking, falls short in capturing situational factors like home court advantage, injuries, or attendance. POMP-ELO addresses these shortcomings by modeling team strength dynamically and evaluating its predictive power relative to baseline models.

Our two main research questions are:
- Can we identify which covariates significantly impact team strength?
- Does the POMP-ELO model possess better prediction capabilities?
